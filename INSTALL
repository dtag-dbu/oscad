How to set up / install your own OSCAd instance:
------------------------------------------------

(1) generate a directory 'toscad' under your web server root directory.
(2) copy the complete content of this directory into
    this newly generated 'toscad' directory
(3) Change into that directory /???/toscad/fileadmin/php/
(4) Open a shell and call php ./prepare-oscad.php
(5) Call your webserver url: http.//your-domain/toscad/index.html

READY.

(6) If you want to modify the frontent, generate new html files etc.
(7) If you want to modify the representation of the answers,
    modify /???/toscad/fileadmin/php/fileadmin/php/include-files/oscad-view-results-inc.php
(8) If you want to improve the computed answers, modify the files under
    /???/toscad/fileadmin/php/fileadmin/php/fileadmin/php/master-files/
    and call again ./prepare-oscad.php - as described above.


Happy Coding
